# Pair Programming and TDD #
Myself and Marco paired to solve the FizzBuzz problem using a TDD approach.
Within both the Lib and Spec folders you can locate the fizzbuzz files to view 
how we reached our most recent solution using a test driven approach.

## Greeter and Roman Numerals ##
After some internet connection issues during our first meet we were unable to 
complete the FizzBuzz task. So between our first and second pairing session, I 
spent some time following both of the Makers code alongs to get a better 
understanding of not only how to write spec syntax but also the benefits of 
writing test suites and how this can inform the code you write to ensure it is 
functional. 

I have added the two files for each of these small projects in their respective 
folders to showcase this work.

### Summary ###
I have used these further completions as an opporrunity to:
* Update the readme file using the command line and get used to the process of 
  creating clear, concise and informative README's.
* Add some further file commits to this repository. 
* Take a look into and implement some Markdown Syntax(at a very basic level.)
* And with a bit of refactoring I was also able to use the numerals solution to 
  pass the codewars Kata (However I don't claim any rights to this solution.)
